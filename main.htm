         <h1>Popular Parts</h1>
         <div>
            <h2><strong>Engine</strong></h2>
            <p>
		  The purpose of a gasoline car engine is to convert gasoline into motion so that your car can move. Currently the easiest way to create motion from gasoline is to burn the gasoline inside an engine. Therefore, a car engine is an internal combustion engine -- combustion takes place internally.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2><strong>Transmission</strong></h2>
            <p>
		  A transmission is a machine in a power transmission system, which provides controlled application of the power. Often the term transmission refers simply to the gearbox that uses gears and gear trains to provide speed and torque conversions from a rotating power source to another device.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2><strong>Doors</strong></h2>
            <p>
		  A car door is a type of door, typically hinged, but sometimes attached by other mechanisms such as tracks, in front of an opening which is used for entering and exiting a vehicle. A vehicle door can be opened to provide access to the opening, or closed to secure it.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2><strong>Transfer case</strong></h2>
            <p>
		  A transfer case is a part of the drivetrain of four-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and other multiple powered axle vehicles. The transfer case transfers power from the transmission to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2><strong>Air bags</strong></h2>
            <p>
             An airbag is a type of vehicle safety device and is an occupant restraint system. The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact with a surface or a rapid sudden deceleration.  
            </p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <h2><strong>Bumpers</strong></h2>
            <p>
              There are two kinds of bumpers that are usually installed in one's car, the front and rear bumpers. These are huge reshaped metal shields designed to absorb shock from minor, low-speed collisions. Each car has a large rubber bumper all around it, which prolongs the impact and diffuses the force of the collision. The bumper cars run on electricity, carried by a pole on the back of the car that leads up to a wire grid in the ride's ceiling. This grid carries the electricity that runs the car.
            </p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <h2><strong>Front and Rear Axle Assembly</strong></h2>
            <p>
		  In rear wheel drive cars and trucks, the engine turns a driveshaft (also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. Modern front wheel drive cars typically combine the transmission (i.e. gearbox and differential) and front axle into a single unit called a transaxle. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles.
		  Is your vehicle beginning to make those grinding and jarring noises when shifting gears? Your axle assembly might have a problem. This sort of problem usually happens to off-roaders, especially to SUVs. 
This is most prevalent to vehicles that travel difficult terrain for the road. It can give much stress to an axle assembly. The road's bumps, turns and potholes and immoderate shifting can really damage a drivetrain, especially its component parts. The axle shaft can give much stress to the CV-joint (constant velocity) or even a U-joint if not properly handled. The gear transfer should be seamless. This could be done if the parts are meticulously greased and are protected from outside elements like dirt. 
Certain steps must be always followed to make sure that your drivetrain assembly is always working fine. The boot or the rubber gasket that protects a CV-joint from dirt and other elements should always be inspected for leaks. Contamination inside the axle assembly can cause much damage for the joints. And repairing is not an easy job to do. Simply flushing contaminants from the drivetrain assembly won't do... and often times, it even worsens the problem. It is so messy and it has a high degree of failure. A small amount of contaminants can really destroy your axle assembly's joints.
