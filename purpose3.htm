The main purpose of project 3 is how to create forms and tables. In the form page, the first thing is to create a a form tag. After that, the legend tag is to create the Customer Information Form title. This form allows the user to input information about themselves in order to get the company know who is visiting the webpage. Also, it informs the the company who is searching the website in order to make updates to the page. The form contains the first name, last name, address, city, state, zipcode. In addition, there is also a section that lets the user choose one language or input a language in case they speak some other language besides English and Spanish. At the end, there are two inputs with types reset and submit. In the other pages created for the months, there are the months of March, April, and May. In all the months, I created the same style for all the months. In the month of March, I inserted some pics for Spring Brake as well as for the month of May I included a graduation pic. The purpose of these pages is to inform the user how to let the company know who searches the website by typing their information.
