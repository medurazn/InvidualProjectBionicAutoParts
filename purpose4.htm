The purpose of this project is to add media to their corresponding pages. This purpose page is added to the div tags located in the main page. In the main page, the first thing to add was a music clip that described the website. In this music clip, the music plays automatically as soon as the page is loaded; however, the controls are left out. Also, in the same main page I added a scrolling text about the popular parts searched by the customers. Next, in the month of April, I added a video about Spring. In this video, I decided to show the controls tab so the user can pause and play as neccesary; additionally, the video will also play automatically as as the video loads. The other thing I did was to add another music clip to the month of May. In the the month of May, the main purpose is graduation, so I added a graduation theme music. Lastly, I included another h3 tag inside the div tag and called it "Video". I also included the link tag so it opens into a new page. In this page I put another video, but this video is the main video of the website because it describes Bionic Auto Parts. To conclude, there is also a "return to the main page" link at the bottom of the page.
