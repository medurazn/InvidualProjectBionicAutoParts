<h1>Purpose Project2</h1>
</header>

<p>The purpose of this website is to let the user learn more about this company and its service. In the main page which is the home page, the first thing we see is a picture. The picture is divided into two sections (hotspots) that will take you to different pages of the website. First, the picture to the left and right will take you to the parts department page and the picture in the middle will take you to the sales department page. Then, we have the div tag to seperate the menu of the page that links to the other webpages as well. The h2 tags are colored blue and the background is in color rgb. I began the first paragraph by capitalizing  the first letter of the first word so it stands out and also colored ir blue. I also included an absolute direct path external link to the company's main page. The picture on the right represents the company's main entrance and I floated to the the right so it aligns with the paragrapgh. In the second paragraph, I started the first sentence in red because I believe this sentence is the main reason this company still up and running. Also, I floated the picture to the left so it aligns with the paragraph. At the end of the page and all the webpages, I've placed a gif pic that represents the company purpose. </p>

<p>In the sales page, I included a picture that represents the page. Then, I put a nav tag where the menu of the website belongs. I created two h2 tags with a background color rgb. The first sentence defines the characteristics of our salesman. I included a nav tag within this characteristics with a description of our salesman perks and the h3 tags inside the nav tag are italic. In the contact information section, I put the company's main phone number and also the salesman specific extension number. I've placed some smiley faces to identify each salesman and also the font is italic. </p>

<p>In the parts page, I've included many pictures that represent the parts that we have here at Bionic Auto Parts. First, I placed a picture that identifies the purpose of the page and the menu put it as a nav tag. There are also h2 tags through out the whole page. I've included two section that represent the mechanical and body parts. In the mechanical parts, I've placed links within the page and same for the body parts. In this page, there are also many h4 tags that belong to each car part and also made it color red. And lastly, at the end of the page I've included a link that takes you to the top of the page.</p>
